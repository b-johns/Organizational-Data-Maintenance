# Organizational-Data-Maintenance
This repository includes Python code used in updating, fixing, and maintaining historical data files for an educational institution.

The basic structure of the code may be of interest to anyone looking to create efficient solutions to reformatting large numbers of files to a common format. But the specific classes and methods therein are unique to the college for which the code was written, and therefore the program likely will not be useful unless one makes significant changes.

Most of the useful content is included in the classes themselves. Methods include ways to rename, reorder, add, and drop fields to get files to match up with newer formats. Additional methods are included to split certain files into multiple ones, and to write out the new, reformatted files.

Some of the code near the beginning of the program is designed to take some user input about which 
type of class should be used to reformat a set of files.
